      <description>These pictures were taken in and around Volunteer Park, in Seattle Washington. This park opened in 1901 and was designed by the Olmstead brothers, who believed that the park would be a serene place for nearby residents to enjoy. The surrounding neighbourhood used to be called &amp;ldquo;Millionaire&amp;rsquo;s Row&amp;rdquo; due to the opulent mansions and estates nearby. </description>

      <description>The December 20 2022 snowfall delayed Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s buses and led to the cancellation of UBC&amp;rsquo;s exams for the day. My final Computer Science exam was impacted, rescheduled for some other time in the new year. So, what better way to spend the afternoon than to walk along Jericho beach? A thick layer of snow is a rarity in Vancouver. </description>

      <description>In the late Fall, the air is sharp. The colour in Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s foliage holds on for another month, some of the greens even make it to the Spring. When there&amp;rsquo;s light outside, it&amp;rsquo;s nearly a constant sunrise or sunset, drawing long shadows here and there.</description>

      <description>On a trip to Sylhet in Bangladesh, I spent an afternoon touring the Surma river in a Sampan-style boat. Along the river, there were teams of labourers using buckets and shovels to transfer sand from the riverbed into boats, then down the riverbank into piles. According to our driver, these labourers are paid about 80 Taka (~1 CAD) per cubic foot of sand delivered to the riverbank. </description>

It links the oldest part of Istanbul, hosting the Ottoman imperial palace and religious landmarks to the newer, more secular part of the city.
