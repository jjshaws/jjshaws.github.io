I originally found this book on a list of Noam Chomsky’s suggested readings. The author, Howard Zinn, was a Political Science professor at Boston University. It turns out that Chomsky and Zinn had a close relationship, first meeting back in the ’60s in Boston, where they became friends. During Chomsky’s public discussions, Zinn would often act as an opener for Chomsky. He says, “I was the warm-up,” funny enough.\nEarly in the book, Zinn states that the history he presents doesn’t aim for neutrality and that he wrote from the viewpoint of the oppressed instead of focusing on traditional historical perspectives of political leaders and elites. “I will try not to overlook the heroes among the oppressors. I will try to balance the inevitable bias. But I do not pretend to be neutral. I do not want to be balanced as much as I want to give an accurate account of the past that is not dictated by those who have traditionally had the most power.” In line with this, the book highlights the struggles of ordinary people in their varied resistances.\nThe early chapters of the book discuss various resistances of opressed groups, like that of Native Americans against colonization in the earliest days of American settlement and as they were pushed westward during periods of expansion. It details the struggles for freedom by enslaved people and then explores the resistance of colonists against British rule. To give an idea of the types of events Zinn delves into, here’s an example of early class struggle with the Anti-Rent Movement. In the mid-19th century, tenant farmers in New York revolted against the patroon system, a semi-feudal land ownership structure where landlords—the patroons—owned large swaths of land. During the period of Dutch colonial rule in the 1600s, wealthy landlords were granted this land in New York. Tenants farmed the land but had no ownership rights and were required to pay high rents, often through their produce, labor, or cash.\nSome of the largest estates, like that of the Van Rensselaer family, covered 700,000 acres and housed thousands of tenants. Zinn portrays the patroons as wielding significant legal power, with courts often siding with landlords, leaving the tenants with very little legal protection. In a grassroots effort, the tenants collectively refused to pay rent, effectively targeting the foundation of the patroon system. They organized mass protests and demonstrations demanding fair treatment and, in some cases, took dramatic measures, such as disguising themselves as “Calico Indians” to intimidate rent collectors. By appropriating the image of Native Americans, the tenants turned a symbol of victimization into a badge of defiance. Instead of being seen as a disorganized group of lawbreakers, they positioned themselves as inheritors of a tradition of resistance against authority.\nZinn describes an incident where a sheriff attempted to sell the livestock of a farmer named Moses Earle, who owed $60 in rent, and was killed by the “Calico Indians.” In response, the governor sent 300 troops to squash the rebellion, and the anti-renters were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. It was made clear to farmers that if they sought to change the system, they should vote and pursue reform through more acceptable measures. In the end, after a new governor was elected, the New York legislature enacted modest reforms to the rent and lease laws, transforming arbitrary agreements into standardized contracts that capped rents and prevented evictions without due process. At the very least, this evolved the patroonship system from a near-feudal structure to one with avenues for legal oversight.\nLater in the book, Zinn highlights similar dynamics in the 20th century, such as the labor movement of the 1930s, where mass strikes forced reforms to working conditions and pay, and the Civil Rights Movement, where non-violent protests led to landmark federal legislation against discrimination. The cycle of grassroots protest leading to reform, which Zinn emphasizes throughout the book, contributes to his overarching argument that history should focus on the experiences and struggles of ordinary people, not just the politically powerful, in shaping the direction and evolution of the nation. So, today’s protests and advocacy campaigns are part of a long-standing tradition of direct action that shapes policy and holds leaders accountable.\n","wordCount":"729","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-29T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jjshaws.github.io/posts/aphotus/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"JamesShaw.info","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jjshaws.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jjshaws.github.io/ accesskey=h title="JamesShaw.info (Alt + H)">JamesShaw.info</a>
