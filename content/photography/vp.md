These pictures were taken in and around Volunteer Park, in Seattle Washington. This park opened in 1901 and was designed by the Olmstead brothers, who believed that the park would be a serene place for nearby residents to enjoy. The surrounding neighbourhood used to be called "Millionaire's Row" due to the opulent mansions and estates nearby.
