The December 20 2022 snowfall delayed Vancouver's buses and led to the cancellation of UBC's exams for the day. My final Computer Science exam was impacted, rescheduled for some other time in the new year. So, what better way to spend the afternoon than to walk along Jericho beach? A thick layer of snow is a rarity in Vancouver.
