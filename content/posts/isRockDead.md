Rock hasn’t maintained the widespread popularity that it once had. In 1983, rock music dominated the Billboard Hot 100 and occupied 60.9% of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 throughout the year, diminished to only 1.4% in 2016 (1). Though rock may not be as easily identified in the commercial charts today, it continues to be actively released and distributed. The rock Releases section of Bandcamp hosts hundreds of albums released the past week alone, tagged under a variety of subgenres of rock. Online distribution platforms are one of many ways that the genre has continued to remain relevant and widely available to those who are interested.

The University of British Columbia’s own Discorder magazine also publishes and provides critical support to the local music scene through interviews, reviews, and its own album chart on a quarterly basis. The CiTR101.9 FM Chart “reflects what’s been played most on air over the last month” on the CiTR Radio station. I listened to singles from the top 25 albums of the May 2021 chart and found that 9 of the 25 releases drew its primary sonic elements from rock music, and/or were labeled as such on the artists’ Bandcamp tags (2). Take the song “Strong Feelings” by Dry Cleaning as an example. Released in 2021, its album occupied the #7 spot on the chart. The defining features of the song are the disjointed, stream of consciousness lyrics. “I just want to tell you I’ve got scabs on my head / It’s useless to live / I’ve been thinking about eating that hot dog for hours / Kiss me”. These lyrics are punctuated by a simple bass and percussion rhythm. Vocalist Florence Shaw stands apart from her accompaniment in ways that remind me of Patti Smith’s delivery on “Gloria: In Excelsis Deo”. Her lyrics are obtuse, reminding me of the associative thought when drifting off to sleep. Dry Cleaning has created original and cohesive rock in this recent release, with other highlights from the album like “Scratchcard Lanyard”.  

Local rock groups continue to produce evocative rock as well. Vancouver’s own Peach Pit released their single “Up Granville” in October stepping up their signature melancholy. The song's twinkling lead guitar and acoustic rhythm draw me in for a catchy chorus. "Even at the cocaine continental / Laughing at the way you cut your lines / Halving all of everybody's bag / And bucking up the time". The subject matter leans into themes of drug use, something we’ve come to expect from rock bands, while introducing softer, ballad like melodies into the mix. Though some have eulogized rock after the turn of the millennium, Peach Pit has had a consistent release schedule and drawn influence from its Canadian jangle rock predecessors, Andy Shauf, and Mac Demarco. 

There is a common thread of intimate, conversational song writing among Peach Pit’s rock influences. Andy Shauf’s “To You” recounts a confessional monologue from one friend to another at a party. The character portrayed seems caught between confessing his love to his friend or cherishing the friendship that they already have. “It's just that sometimes when I'm by your side / It feels so right / (…) / I just mean that you're a good friend / It's hard to explain / Just forget I said anything”. Artists like Andy Shauf who are pushing the boundaries of the genre through fresh subject matter are keeping things interesting and relevant today. Mac Demarco’s slick, bright riffs on “Still Beating” would fit nicely into a new Peach Pit album as well. The softer side of rock is active, and it has been gratifying to watch it grow.

Apart from those who are stripping back the loud guitars to highlight song writing, others have been exploring louder, denser instrumental accompaniments. Bands black midi, IDLES and Black Country, New Road are forging innovative sounds in the UK. Black midi’s “John L” and Black Country, New Road’s “Science Fair” both feature sweat inducing, stilted sonic breakdowns in their second half, as the vocalists reach the apogee of their narrative. They are also accompanied by changes in tempo. “Science Fair” opts for a slower loud saxophone section to conclude the song while Black midi incorporates a 25 second accelerando into the mid-section of “John L” (~2:30). Punk group IDLES take a more familiar approach in the first section of “Colossus”, the opener of their 2018 album “Joy as an Act of Resistance”. The first section of the song features a crescendo that peaks at around the 3:40 mark followed by some fast-paced thrashing guitar to conclude. 

The bands illuminati hotties and Turnstile cover more of rock’s bases with catchy rock choruses. Illuminati hotties single “MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA” does just what the title suggests, the chorus goes “Mm-mm-mm / Oh-oh-oh / Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah / Yeah yeah” over a sweet melodic guitar progression. Though vocalist Sarah Tudzin often steps into juvenile territory with her lyrics like “I sit around like an old tortilla, Folded and flat, full of mold and bugs”, she sure makes me want to dance. Band Turnstile’s approach to the chorus is to follow a tried-and-true brand of loud, in your face stadium rock on the song “MYSTERY”. The loud, overdriven power chords and chorus effect on the vocals pay homage to past styles of popular rock. This is to say that there are modern rock bands are still looking to make their audience dance, jump and otherwise rock out to loud guitar.

Rock may have lost its mainstream prevalence, but it’s alive and well. Asking if it’s dead paints a misleading image where the genre is an entity with distinct edges. Rock is loosely defined, a characteristic of popular music with common ancestry, shared traditions, and conventions. These 10 songs that I see as active continuations the rock tradition: electric guitar, evocative storytelling, and energetic melodies. I look forward to future iteration and evolution of the genre.

Each charting song was paired with a genre using Spotify’s API, and supplemental genre data was found on EveryNoise.com, AllMusic.com, and Wikipedia. Though we’re missing recent 5 years of data, but the plot demonstrates my point, nonetheless. The Spotify API returns a list of genres for each song, with the first genre being the most recognizable or immediate. This first genre of this list was chosen to represent the song’s overall genre, though there is no guaranteed consensus on the choice of overarching parent genre. For example, Radioactive is categorized as pop music while there are rather clear components of rock. The song charted on both pop and rock lists, but I digress. I claim that the billboard top 100’s genre distribution is indicative of what’s popular, and rock’s presence is being dwarfed by rap and pop.
