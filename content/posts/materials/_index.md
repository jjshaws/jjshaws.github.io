I spent 5 years studying materials engineering at the University of British Columbia and the National University of Singapore. I've come to learn that our battle for stronger, lighter, more durable, more available materials is hard-fought and ongoing. Our ability to tailor the properties of materials boils down to our ability to arrange matter at scale. Carbon arranged into linear chains at the nano scale creates graphene, the strongest known structure to man. Humans have been quenching swords to increase their hardness since at least the bronze age, a process that freezes microscopic grains of metal into a strong orientation. We have been tailoring our materials ever since.

I'm particularly interested in our recent advancements in materials manufacturing at the meso-scale, that of the human eye. Here are a few projects that seek to make use of our recent advancements in additive manufacturing, aka 3D printing to open applications for the tech.
