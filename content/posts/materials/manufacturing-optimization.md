title: "3D Printing Support Optimization"
---

I worked with NewPro3D, a Vancouver based 3D printing company to help them better understand the importance of support structure placement in their printing process. Starting from first principles, my team developed models for failure as a function of printing parameters such as print speed, layer thickness. Our model allowed the company to determine the optimal distance between support structures, ultimately decreasing the print time, print cost and time spent removing supports after curing.

I found this project rewarding becuase the solution involved combining knowledge that took my whole engineering degree to cultivate. Static mechanics met modeling and communication.
