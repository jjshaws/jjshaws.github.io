Eminem is one of the most recognizable names in hip hop. Though there are many reasons that contribute to his success, I’d like to focus particularly on how his persona as a poor white person led to his eventual success in popularizing hip-hop with white listeners, in a genre traditionally for black listeners by black hip hop artists.

Hip Hop made an early impression on Mathers, he found an outlet in writing raps at the age of 14 (Ford 127). Born in a small rural city outside of Kansas called St-Joseph, fatherlessness, family suicide, his mother’s drug abuse and poverty lead to a great deal of displacement in his life, including a move to a poor, primarily black neighbourhood in Detroit. In his breakout record “The Slim Shady LP” Mathers fleshes out a portrait of his younger self, as a victim of abuse. In “Brain Damage”, he writes about an incident with a bully in Detroit at the age of nine, which left him hospitalized for four days for a cerebral hemorrhage, according to Mathers’ mother’s memoir (Nelson). The song begins with Mathers on the table in the operating theatre, convulsing, then narrating the events: “He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose / Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat / I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef" / But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe / He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honky!"”. In addition to his childhood traumas, he speaks about his current struggles in the song “If I had”. He says, “I’m tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor / Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store / (…) / Tired of not drivin' a BM / Tired of not workin' at GM”. These experiences of degradation and disenfranchisement become central to Mathers’ persona in future releases, as his audience grows. 

“Brain Damage” stands shoulder to shoulder on his LP with the songs that introduced Slim Shady to a wider audience. In the lead single “My name is”, Eminem raps about pop culture events of the moment and importantly further establishes his poor upbringing and dysfunctional interactions with women. “All my life I was very deprived / I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide / (…) / When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits / How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits”. His nasally delivery on this song stands out against the deep vocal tone delivered by rappers of the era. Listen to the contrast between Marshall and his mentor, Dr Dre in the 1999 release “Forgot About Dre” at the 1:04 mark. What is important to note with Mather’s lyrical content and delivery is that he differentiates himself from the stereotypes of black rappers. Black machismo is a primary element of the genre. With it comes authenticity and admission to hip hop culture. However, in “My name is”, he presents himself in contrast to the norm, as incapable with women and socially inept.

Despite his personal problems, Eminem continues his run of commercial success in the early 2000s. His third studio album The Marshall Mathers LP sells a record-breaking 1.76 million copies in it’s first week (MTV News). In the song “Stan”, Mathers recounts the story of an obsessive, young, white fan who commits murder-suicide after receiving no response in letters he sends to Eminem. In the lyrics, Stan relates to Mathers’ childhood problems, and Stan’s inability to relate to his girlfriend. “She don't know what it was like for people like us growing' up”. The song is a vignette of a growing, obsessive, reverence for Eminem, much of which stems from a shared experience of failures to connect with women and impoverished upbringings in Middle America.

In a single from his 2002 album Encore, Mathers looks from a distance at the impact he has had on public discourse surrounding rap music. In the song “White America”, he attributes his success to his ability to relate to white Americans. He speaks about the blue contacts he wears on stage and his bleached hair, a costume he wears to boost sales. “Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself / If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf”. He also alludes to the sudden panic among white parents about their children listening to music objectifying women. He makes the point that this was not a problem when the audience was black. “Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston / After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom”. An outcome of this controversy was increased attention to his music, which propelled him more intensely into the limelight.

As a result, Eminem has been cited by many rappers and other artists as an influence on their music. Kendrick Lamar says, “Em definitely influenced a lot in my style” (Andres). Parallels in Lamar’s content and flow are especially apparent on his track “Sing About Me, I’m Dying Of Thirst”, where Lamar addresses himself from the perspective of a close friend, leaving a message on his answering machine. The steadfast cadence, narrative and laid-back instrumental are all elements shared with Mathers’ “Stan”. In addition, Drake is a well-known fan of Eminem’s. Drake has introduced Mathers on stage as the “greatest rapper” (Lars), he owns Eminem collectibles (Rebublic World), and has borrowed the chorus of Mather’s Superman in his 2020 release “Chicago Freestyle (feat. Giveon)”. One final example of Eminem’s influence is found in rapper Meek Mill’s 2014 release song “Ooh Kill Em” where he quotes Mather’s chorus from “Forgot About Dre” and samples the beat.

Over the span of his breakout success of the late 1990s and early 2000s, Eminem shaped a poignant persona that allowed white audiences to further relate and interact with hip hop music and culture. In discussing his troubled upbringing and presenting himself as an impoverished white person, he stood far enough from black hip-hop stereotypes to be seen as palatable to Middle America, and close enough to make inroads in the existing industry.
