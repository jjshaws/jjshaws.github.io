title: "Bone Scaffold Strength Testing"
---

Bone disorder prevalence is increasing, largely due to an aging global population. Consequently, researchers are looking to novel methods for the treatment and replacement of atrophied bone. In this project, I tested the mechanical strength of a variety of 3D printed bone scaffold structures. They were designed such that so called "bone resorption", or a prosthetic's ability to be reintegrated into the body would occur. I compared comventional bone scaffold designs (truss and TPMS) with topologically optimized designs.
